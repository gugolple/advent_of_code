In this problem I had a solution that was deemed invalid because there were tow disconnected areas defined by the pipe.
My algorithm counted them both and got reprimanded. When removed the small second area the answer was correct.

The solution for the puzzle was to add a space between all characters and then fill that in. This will allow to detect
the passages just by doing extension coverage.
